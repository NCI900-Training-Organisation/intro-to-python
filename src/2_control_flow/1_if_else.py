Indentation in Python is crucial because it defines the structure and flow of the code. 
Unlike many other languages that use braces or keywords to mark code blocks, Python uses 
indentation to group statements. Each level of indentation indicates a new block or scope, 
which makes it both a syntax requirement and an organizational tool. 

This strict indentation enforces readability and uniform coding style, helping developers 
quickly understand code logic. Errors in indentation lead to syntax errors.
