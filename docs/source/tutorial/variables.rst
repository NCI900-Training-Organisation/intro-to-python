            #. Learn about variables in Python

A variable is like a *container* or a *label* that holds a value you can use and change later in a program.

..  code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    a = 2

    b = 'abc'

    a = 3.14

.. admonition:: Explanation
   :class: attention

   You can think of a variable as a box that you can put things in. You can also change the contents of the box whenever you want.
   The name of the box is the variable name, and the contents of the box are the value of the variable.
   In the example above, we created a variable called `a` and assigned it the value `2`. Then we changed the value of `a` to `3.14`.
   
   You can use variables to store all kinds of data, including numbers, strings, lists, and more.
   You can also use variables to perform calculations and manipulate data.


Variable names:

* can include letters, digits, and underscores
* cannot start with a digit
* are case sensitive.

Types of Data

* integer numbers
