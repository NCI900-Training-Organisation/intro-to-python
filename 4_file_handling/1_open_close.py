Basic File Handling Modes in Python
-------------------------------------
* "r": Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading.
* "w": Write mode. Opens the file for writing (overwrites the file if it exists or creates a new one if it doesnâ€™t).
* "a": Append mode. Opens the file for appending new data to the end of the file.
* "r+": Read and write mode. Allows reading and writing at the same time.
